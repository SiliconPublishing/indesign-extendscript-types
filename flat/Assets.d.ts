   * * Names are accepted, as with {@link item}: `layers.itemByRange('Top', 'Bottom')`.
   * * Like `everyItem()`, this returns a plural proxy. Operations applied to this proxy are broadcast directly within the native engine for maximum performance.
   * * To convert this proxy into a standard JavaScript array of individual objects, call `.getElements()` on the result.
   * * A range of text (`characters`, `words`, ...) is one piece of text: its reads are
   * one-element arrays, `story.characters.itemByRange(2, 5).contents` → `['cdef']` (which prints
   * as `cdef`), and `parentStory` → `[story]`: take `[0]`. `getElements()` resolves the whole range
   * to a single `Text` (`contents` a plain string), the form to pass on; its `characters` are the
   * individual characters.
   * Per-item members such as `parentTextFrames` give one array per item.

   * @param to The object or index at the end of the range.
